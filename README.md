## Key Features

### Multi-user support
Multiple users can track their workout data using different accounts.

### Record your workout data
Record the data of your workout sessions after you have finished them.

Supported workout types:

Distance-based:
- Biking
- Running
- Hiking

Duration-based:
- Fitness Workouts

You can fill in a lot of information for each workout session. If the pre-defined inputs are not enough, it is possible to set custom fields for each type of workout.

You can share your workouts via public links.

### Month goals
Set custom month goals (either distance, duration or number of workouts).
The current status of each month goal is visualized via progress bars.

### GPX tracks / Map
A GPX recoding can be attached to every distance-based workout. The GPX recordings can be viewed on a map.

View a single gpx track on a map, with additional information (e.g. track line is colored according to speed):

### FIT tracks
SportTracker also supports .fit files in addition to gpx. Those files will be stored in the `data` folder as well.  
During upload of a .fit file for a workout or planned tour, a gpx file is automatically generated from the .fit file.

__NOTE__: The converted gpx file will only contain basic data like latitude, longitude, timestamps and altitude information. 

#### Use FIT file to prefill workout form
SportTracker also allows to use .fit files to automatically prefill the workout form with data from the .fit file (e.g. duration, distance, etc.)

### Tile Hunting
Each user can optionally enable tile hunting.   
If enabled an additional map is provided that shows all already visited tiles. A tile is considered visited if one or more gpx tracks cross it. By default, the size of a tile is equivalent to the size of an OpenStreetMap tile at zoom level 14 (This can be configured in the SportTracker settings file).
Tile hunting can be useful to discover new areas in your surrounding or gain some motivation to explore new routes.
The tile hunting map will also show the maximum square area that is completely covered by your visited tiles.

#### Tile hunting overlay access
To plan your next tile hunting route you may want to allow access to your tile hunting map via a share code in your user settings.  
This can be useful to add a custom overlay to OpenStreetMap based maps, e.g. https://bikerouter.de.

1. Add a custom overlay layer
2. Use the url shown on your user settings page (e.g. http://localhost/map/tileOverlay/1df60cca70c340239cfd869673443be4/{z}/{x}/{y}.png)

### Tile Hunting heatmap
In addition to the normal tile hunting map a heatmap is available.  
Each tile will be colored according to the number of workouts that visited each tile.  
You can click on the map to get the exact number of visits per tile.

### Charts
Tracked data is visualized in charts, e.g.:
- Distance per month
- Average speed
- Duration per workout
- etc.

Example charts:

### Annual Statistics
Every year is summarized for each workout type.

### Achievements
The achievement page shows aggregated information about all your workouts.

### Maintenance Events
Record your maintenance events for each workout type.  
You can optionally set reminders for each maintenance.  
SportTracker can be configured to send notifications via a ntfy server once a maintenance reminder is triggered.

### Planned Tours
Save your planned tours for each workout type (distance-based types) and view them on a map. Once you actually took a planned tour you can link the corresponding workout to the tour.

Share planned tours with other SportTracker users or create public links.

#### Enable GPX review Images

SporTracker can show a preview image for each planned tour. The images are not generated by SportTracker.  
An external service can be used instead.

In order to activate gpx preview images, follow these steps:

**1. Set up a georender instance https://github.com/deadlocker8/georender (forked from https://github.com/loskoderos/georender)**
- a) Build docker image: `docker build -t georender .`
- b) Run docker image with specific settings: `docker run -p 3000:3000 georender -w 800 -h 450 -t osm`

**2. Enable gpx preview images in your SporTracker settings.json
Update the section `gpxPreviewImages` in your settings.json to contain the following values**
```json
"gpxPreviewImages": {
    "enabled": true,
    "geoRenderUrl": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```
Where http://localhost:3000 is the address and port number of your georender instance started in step 1.

### Available languages
- German
- English


## API
SportTracker offers a basic REST-API for the most common use-cases.  
The corresponding swagger-ui is available at `/api/v2/docs`


## Run SportTracker
1. Install dependencies via `poetry install --no-root --without dev`
2. Copy `settings-example.json` to `settings.json` and adjust to your configuration
3. Run the server: `<path_to_python_executable_in_poetry_venv> src/SportTracker.py` 

ðŸ’¡ Or use the docker image.

## Command line arguments
- `--debug`, `-d` = Enable debug mode
- `--dummy`, `-dummy` = Generate dummy workouts and demo user


## Database migration
Updating to the latest SportTracker release may require database migration.   
This is only necessary if you already have a running SportTracker instance and a database filled with entries.  
Whether a database migration is necessary will be stated in the release notes.  
The migration will be performed automatically upon start of SportTracker.
